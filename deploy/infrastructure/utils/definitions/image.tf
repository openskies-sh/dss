variable "image" {
  type        = string
  description = <<EOT
  Full name of the docker image built in the section above. build.sh prints this name as
  the last thing it does when run with DOCKER_URL set. It should look something like
  gcr.io/your-project-id/dss:2020-07-01-46cae72cf if you built the image yourself as
  documented in /build/README.md, or docker.io/interuss/dss.

  `latest` can be used to use the latest official interuss docker image.

  Example: `latest` or `docker.io/interuss/dss:v0.6.0`
